# ### üß† Question Mapping Using Language Model API
# 
# This code defines a simple NLP-based assistant that maps a user's natural language question to a predefined list of known questions. 
# 
# - The `known_questions` list contains all supported queries the assistant can recognize.
# - The `prompt_builder(user_main_question)` function constructs a prompt string for the language model. It asks the model to match the user's input with the most relevant known question.
# - The `question_map(question)` function:
#   - Sends the constructed prompt to a locally hosted LLaMA3 language model via a REST API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`).
#   - Parses the response and returns the matched known question.
#   - If the model responds with `"None"`, or if an error occurs (e.g., timeout, server issue), it returns `None`.
# 
# This mechanism is useful for handling flexible user input by grounding it to a fixed set of query types that can be handled downstream.

# # üöÄ Full Flask API for Translating Natural Language to SQL Queries
# 
# This script implements a Flask API that accepts natural language questions, maps them to SQL queries for a MySQL cricket database (`cric_data`), executes those queries, and returns JSON results.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## ‚úÖ 1. App Initialization
# - Creates a Flask app instance via `Flask(__name__)`.
# - Defines `db_config` with parameters for connecting to the MySQL `cric_data` database.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## üîÅ 2. Question to SQL Mapping (`map_question_to_sql`)
# - Maps user questions (in lowercase) to predefined SQL queries.
# - Contains explicit mappings for known questions, returning SQL strings tailored for each.
# - Returns `None` if no exact mapping is found.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## üß† 3. Question Resolution Logic (inside `/query` POST endpoint)
# - Receives a JSON POST with a `"question"` key.
# - The logic proceeds in this order:
#   1. **Direct Mapping:** Try to map the exact user question via `map_question_to_sql`.
#   2. **LLM-Based Mapping:** If no direct SQL found, sends the user question to a local LLM API (`question_map()`) which attempts to find the closest known question phrasing, then tries SQL mapping again.
#   3. **Fuzzy Matching:** If the LLM returns no match, attempts a fuzzy string match (`fuzzy_match_question()`) against known questions for approximate matching.
#   4. If no SQL query is found after all steps, returns HTTP 400 with an error message.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## üóÑÔ∏è 4. SQL Execution
# - Connects to MySQL using `mysql.connector` with `db_config`.
# - Executes the generated SQL query and fetches results as dictionaries.
# - Closes the database connection cleanly.
# - Returns a JSON response containing:
#   - The original user question.
#   - The SQL query used (for debugging/clarity).
#   - The query results.
# - If SQL execution fails, returns HTTP 500 with the error message.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## üßµ 5. Running the Flask API
# - Defines a `run_flask()` function that starts the Flask server on port 5000 with debugging enabled.
# - Runs this function inside a background thread (`Thread(target=run_flask).start()`), so the server runs asynchronously (useful for running inside Jupyter or other environments without blocking).
# 
# ---
# 
# ## üß© Overall Workflow
# - The API transforms flexible natural language questions into structured SQL commands by layering:
#   - Direct keyword matching
#   - Semantic LLM mapping
#   - Fuzzy string matching
# - This layered approach allows users to ask cricket-related questions in natural language and get accurate database responses.
# ata using flexible natural language queries.
