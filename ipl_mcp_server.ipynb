    "This script implements a Flask API that accepts natural language questions, maps them to SQL queries for a MySQL cricket database (`cric_data`), executes those queries, and returns JSON results.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## ✅ 1. App Initialization\r\n",
    "- Creates a Flask app instance via `Flask(__name__)`.\r\n",
    "- Defines `db_config` with parameters for connecting to the MySQL `cric_data` database.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 🔁 2. Question to SQL Mapping (`map_question_to_sql`)\r\n",
    "- Maps user questions (in lowercase) to predefined SQL queries.\r\n",
    "- Contains explicit mappings for known questions, returning SQL strings tailored for each.\r\n",
    "- Returns `None` if no exact mapping is found.\r\n",

    "  1. **Direct Mapping:** Try to map the exact user question via `map_question_to_sql`.\r\n",

    "## 🧵 5. Running the Flask API\r\n",
    "- Defines a `run_flask()` function that starts the Flask server on port 5000 with debugging enabled.\r\n",
